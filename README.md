This Allows for Actuall alpha servers to run without the player524 issue, bassicly every player who logs in is player524 and the inventory is shared obviously a big issue for running a alpha server, (i added the orginal bins for 1.7.3 so you can use it as a alternative to beta craft launcher) hopefully alpha servers starting poping up as this issue is now fixed by using the orginal bin folder.
